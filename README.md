### Project Overview
There are 1.88 million clients in this dataset. There are 1.5 million clients in train and 380,000 clients in test. The objective of this challenge is to create a machine-learning model that can forecast the probability of each customer becoming inactive and refraining from making any transactions for a period of 90 days.

### What is Customer Churn?
It is the process of using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service. Churn, in this context, refers to customer attrition or the loss of customers from this African Telecommunications Company.
